# Doviz Exchange Simulator & Projectile Motion Simulation

This repository contains two distinct projects: a currency exchange simulator and a projectile motion simulation implemented in Python. Each project is detailed below:

## Doviz Exchange Simulator (IkinciKod.py)
This project simulates currency exchange rates for different currencies. It allows users to input the currency type, amount, and transaction type (buy or sell). The simulator then calculates the total amount based on the chosen exchange rate and displays the result.

### Usage
1. Run the `IkinciKod.py` script.
2. Select the currency type (Euro, Dollar, Sterling, Swiss Franc).
3. Input the amount to exchange.
4. Choose the transaction type (buy or sell).
5. The simulator calculates and displays the total amount.

## Projectile Motion Simulation (UcuncuKod.py)
This project simulates the motion of a projectile launched with a specified velocity and angle. It calculates and visualizes the trajectory of the projectile, attempting to hit a target. The simulation incorporates various calculations and plots trajectories for different attempts.

### Usage
1. Run the `UcuncuKod.py` script.
2. Adjust the initial velocity and launch angle.
3. The simulation calculates the projectile's trajectory and target hit outcome.
4. The trajectory plot is displayed along with target hit information.

Feel free to explore and modify the code in both projects to understand and experiment with different scenarios. Enjoy learning and coding!
